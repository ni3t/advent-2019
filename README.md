# Advent of Code 2019

> I got started two days late this year due to holiday travel.

Notes:

1. Pretty straight forward
2. Brute force is more than ample here, the instruction set is short and the target window is small.

## Instructions

Download the input for a problem:

1. Get your cookie from AoC (inspect the headers - it's called "session")

2. Place cookie (raw text) in a file at the root called `cookie` (no extension)

3. 
    ```sh
    $> ruby util/fetch.rb <day>
    ```
